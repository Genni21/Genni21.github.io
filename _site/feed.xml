&lt;p&gt;As my first post, I might aswell just write something completely random, and what better random thing to write than math :)
Let’s just write a solution to an exercise from the abstract algebra book of Dummit and Foote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(G\) be a finite group, and let \(x, y\) be two elements of \(G\) of order \(2\) such that the set \(S=\{x, y \}\) is a 
set of generators of \(G\). Prove that \(G \cong D_{2n}\) where  \(n = |xy|\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proof:
If \(x, y\) are generators of \(G\) then it follows that  \(xy, x\) also generate  \(G\). Remembering that one of the presentations for
the dihedral group is  \(D_{2n} = \{ r, s ; r^n = s^2 = 1 \}\) we observe that this presentation is valid if we choose \(r = xy \text{ and } s = x\).
This means that there is a unique homomorphism mapping elements from \(G\) to elements of \(D_{2n}\). Remembering that the set \(\{r, s\}\) is a set of generators of \(D_{2n}\),  we note that the map is surjective, because all elements of \(D_{2n}\) can be obtained from the application of the map to elements of \(G\) . Note also that \(|G| = |H| = 4\) and whenever the map is both surjective, and the groups are both of equal finite order, then we know that the map is bijective. Thus
\(G \cong D_{2n}\).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Random" /><summary type="html">This is my first post on this website! It probably will be deleted once the blog has more posts, but hey it’s cool :)</summary></entry></feed>
