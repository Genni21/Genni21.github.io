I'm Genni, a first year Computer Science and Engineering student at [Politecnico di Milano][poli-website].

This page will mostly be made of writeups of:
1. CTFs I have played and solved;
2. Detailed explanations of crypto attacks in an attempt to understand them well enough myself;
3. Notes of my self study, concerning mostly math/computer science topics :)
