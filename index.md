  Hey everybody, this is the blog of (yet another) math/computer science enjoyer :)

### What can one find here?

  The stuff in here will mostly (and hopefully) be technical, so you can hope to either: 
  1. find some very specific posts, guiding through my thought process in tackling some problems, in the hopes of remembering it myself, OR
  2. find notes that barely scratch the surface of a topic I am just trying to learn.
